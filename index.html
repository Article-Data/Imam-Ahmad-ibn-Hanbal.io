<h1 style="color:Gold; font-size:40px; text-align:center;"> <b> <u> IMAM AHMED IBN HANBAL </u> </b> </h1> <br>

<p style="color:Gold; font-size:25px; text-align:center;"> <b> Imam Ahmed ibn Hanbal, also known as Imam ibn Hanbal 
is one of the prominent Islamic scholars and has been given the title of Shaykh ul-Islam(meaning Outstanding scholars of the Islamic Sciences). 
He was an Imam in Fiqh, Hadith and many other Silamic Jurisprudence. He is the founder of one of the Four Schools or rites of Islamic legal knowledge(fiqh) 
within the Sunni schools of law.<br>
Imam's full name is Ahmed ibn Mohammad ibn Hanbal Abu Abdullah Al-Shaybani. He was originally from Baghdad, Imam Ahmad was descended from a pure Arabic lineage 
that coincided with the lineage of the Prophet Muhammad(PBUH) from Nizar bin Maad bin Adnan from the clan of Banu Bakr bin Wail.
</b> </p> <br>


<p style="color:Gold; font-size: 25px;">  Imam Ahmad was born and raised in Baghdad, Iraq. He was born in the Islamic month of Rabi-ul-Awwal, 164 AH(After Hijrat). 
His father Mohammad died young at the age of 30 and Imam Ahmad was therefore raised as an orphan.<br>
Imam Ahmad studied extensively in Baghdad. When he finished his primary/elementary Islamic education(The Maktab), Imam began to attend study circles at higher 
level of Islamic education at the age of fourteen. Then he began to focus on studying Hadith. He started learning jurisprudence(Fiqh) under the celebrated Islamic scholar, 
Abu Yusuf, who was a renowned student and companion of Imam Abu Hanifa. Then Imam Ahmad remained a student of Hushaim bin Basheer until his death.
 </p> <br>


<p style="color:Gold; font-size: 25px; text-align:center;"> Imam Ahmad learned and wrote Hadith from more than 280 scholars including: <br>
Yaqub ibn Ibrahim Al-Ansari (better known as Abu Yusuf) <br>
Imam Al-Shafi'i <br>
Hushaim bin Basheer <br>
Ibrahim ibn Saad <br>
Yahya bin Saeed Al-Qattan <br>
Abu Mohammad Sufyan Ibn Uyaynah <br>
Imam Yazeed bin Haroon <br>
Imam Wakee ibn Al-Jarrah <br>
And lot's of other scholars at their time.
</p> <br>

<p style="color:Gold; font-size: 25px; text-align:center;"> Imam Ahmad's notable students include: <br>
1. Abu Al-Hasan Ali ibn Muhammad Al-Mawardi. <br>
2. Abu Bakr Al-Athram. <br>
3. Salih bin Ahmad (Imam's Son). <br>
4. Abdullah bin Ahmad (Imam's Son). <br>
5.Abu Dawood Sulayman (famously known as Abu Dawood). <br>
6. Hambal bin Ishaaq. <br>
And many other well-known scholars of that time.
</p> <br>

<p style="color:Gold; font-size: 25px;"> The Governor of Yemen, while paying a visit to Makkah, met Imam Al-Shafi'i, discerned at his unique abilities, he offered him 
an administrative post in Yemen but like his predecessor Imam Abu Hanifa, Imam Shafi'i also suffered political persecution and intrigues, but thankfully, 
unlike Imam Abu Hanifa, he was not subjected to torture.<br>
Imam Al-Shafi'i was arrested and charged with the offense of political interference in Yemen. <br> 
The Caliph of that time, Haroon Al-Rashid examined him and found him to be innocent of all the charges and discharged him with Honour.
</p> <br>

<p style="color:Gold; font-size: 25px;"> During his studies, he heard about the death of Imam Malik. He then went to Kufah.<br>
He memorized all the books of Imam Wakee ibn Al-Jarrah and was also taught by him. Imam Ahmad learned Islamic law from Imam Al-Shafi'i. 
Imam Ahmad began traveling through Iraq, Syria and Arabia to collect Hadiths. During his travel, he wrote down about 300,000 Hadiths.<br>
It did not take long for Imam Ahmad to become widely known. More and more people started to become his students. People loved his teaching because he possessed wide 
knowledge about Islam and he was recognized as a highly pious man who spared no effort in the pursuit and dissemination of knowledge.
</p> <br>

<p style="color:Gold; font-size: 25px;"> When he was 40 years old, Imam Ahmad became a prominent figure in the filed of Hadith and Fatwa. More and more people 
began to come to him from the neighboring cities for learning Islamic Fiqh. <br>
Imam Ahmad continued his work and narration of Hadiths and Fatwas. He did not leave Baghdad until the time of Mihnah. The Mihnah, also known as Mihnah Khalaq Al-Quran, 
refers to the period of religious persecution instituted by the Abbasid Caliph Abul-Abbas Al-Mamun in 883 AD.<br>
During this period Islamic Scholars were punished, imprisoned or even killed unless they conformed to the self-made and false Mutazilah theology by some people at that time.<br>
This policy lasted for 15 years from 883 to 848 AD and was widely supported by the most Caliphs of that time.
</p> <br>

<p style="color:Gold; font-size: 25px;"> Caliph Al-Mamun declared his view that the Quran was created and tried to impose this false-understanding of his on 
people including scholars. This was a testing times for true Islamic Scholars and Jurists.<br>
However, along with Imam Ahmad, many true scholars remained steadfast in their view that the Quran is the word of Allah and was not created. 
He was taken to Caliph Al-Mamun in chains but when he reached Al-Raqqa(Currently located in Syria), news of death of Al-Mamun came and Caliph Abu Ishaq Al-Mutasim became the 
successor of Al-Mamun.<br>
However, Al-Mutasim did not show any kindness towards scholars and therefore, Imam Ahmad remained in prison in Baghdad until the death of Al-Mutasim and revived the policy/pratice 
of testing scholars regarding the issue of Mihnah.
</p> <br>

<p style="color:Gold; font-size: 25px;"> However, Imam Ahmad was released with the condition to go back to his hometown in Baghdad.<br>
Imam Ahmad isolated himself from the people and remained in his house until the death of Al-Watiq. Abul Fadl Jafar Al-Mutawakkil became Caliph and successor of 
Al-Watiq and issues orders of stopping testing of scholars. It was during this testing time thatbhe had made a promise to Allah that he would not narrate any Hadith in complete form until
his death.<br>
This doesn't mean that he gave up completely on discussing issues of knowledge. He spent the rest of his life discussing Islamic Law(Fiqh), reports and the 
biographies of Hadith narrators until his death in 241 AH(After Hijrat). Imam Ahmad had stopped teaching Hadith since 225 AH. He did not narrate any hadith except 
to his two sons Abdullah and Salih.<br>
It was a free time for Imam and he narrated his great book Al-Musnad to his sons and his paternal cousin Hanbal bin Ishaq.
</p> <br>


<p style="color:Gold; font-size: 25px; text-align: center;"> Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal passed away on Friday, 12th Rabbi-ul-Awwa, 241 AH(After Hijrat)
at the age of 77 in Baghdad, Iraq<br> after a brief illness of 9 days and was buried in Baghdad<br>
